## ðŸŽ¯ Thesis

**AI is becoming more prevalent in society with no indication of slowing, but there are fundamental issues that threaten its continued viability:**

1. **Data Exploitation**: Big AI companies have used billions of people's data without attribution or compensation
2. **Trust Collapse**: Deepfakes are eroding societal trust, making it impossible to distinguish real from fake content

**The solution requires three interconnected technologies:**
- **AI** requires **Blockchain** for micropayments and content verification
- **Blockchain** requires **IPv6** for true peer-to-peer communication
- Together, they enable sustainable AI development without collapse

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
